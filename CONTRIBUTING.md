# Contributing Guidelines

Please search issues and pull requests before adding something new to avoid duplicating
efforts and conversations.

This project welcomes non-code contributions too. The following types of contributions
are welcome:

- **Ideas**: participate in an issue thread or start your own to discuss your idea.
- **Writing**: contribute your expertise in an area by helping expand the included docs.
- **Copy editing**: fix typos, clarify language, and improve the quality of the docs.
- **Formatting**: help keep the docs easy to read by using consistent formatting.

## Code Style

This repository uses [`PEP8`][pep8-url] to maintain code style and consistency.

Test folder names should be lowercase and end with `_tests` (e.g. error_generation_tests).

Test files should also be lowercase and end with `_test.py` (e.g. exceptions_tests.py).

All files and folders should be snake_case.

### Releases

Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.

### Changes to this arrangement

This document may also be subject to pull-requests or changes by contributors where you believe you have something valuable to add or change.
